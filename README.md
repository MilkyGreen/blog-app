# A blog using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript

I use this project to learn nextjs and react, using tailwindcss and some components from antd.

## blog
Generating static web pages from Markdown files.

## links
Backups for my chrome bookmarks. Data is synchronized from the browser extension to a PostgreSQL database, and then displayed under the 'Links' menu. static pages is regenerated every time the synchronization occurs.

Will add new features anytime.
